# Math Lounge Quotes

A list of quotes for use with the common unix utility fortune. 
Taken from the left math lounge door on 2023-01-24.
All wording is kept as close to original as possible, even spelling.
My apologies for any misread names or words.

## To install:
If you just clone this repo you can run fortune with the command 'fortune math_quotes' in this directory. If you want it to work globally you have to put it in fortune's directory on your system (for me it's /usr/share/fortune/).
